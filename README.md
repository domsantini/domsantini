# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dominic and I'm a self-taught software developer currently on a quest to master everything related to Web Development. I recently left a career in Finance and have reignited a genuine joy for my work. When I experiment with a new tool, learn a new trick, or see my ideas in action, I'm reminded that passion and work aren't mutually exclusive. 

Take a look at some of my projects below ðŸ‘‡
